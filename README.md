# LM2_DATAZlib-Decompressor v0.1
Decompress compressed zlib files in Dark Moon. There really better ways doing this.
https://discord.gg/29h7fap

Use it with the tool Offzip created by aluigi: http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm
This just makes it easier to use.

How to use it:
1. Make sure the batch file and the offzip decompressor executable are in the same folder.
2. Open the batch file.
3. Select the folder where the compressed zlib file is.
4. Select the compressed zlib file.
5. Press enter and watch the magic happen.

If you see some errors, you either:

- Did it wrong
- Files arent in the same place
- The file itself isnt compressed with zlib
